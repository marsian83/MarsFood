### **Frontend-Features**
***• for consumers***
  - Login/Signup page
    >There are two seperate pages for user login and user signup. The pages follows a color scheme which represents marsfood's brand identity

- Homepage of the website
    > The homepage of the website contains the most popular restaurants on our website, the most popular dishes and also all the dishes uploaded on the website. The page also has indicators on all dishes to show if they are veg or non veg. The homepage also has a filter to display either dishes or restaurants.

- Pages for dishes and restaurants
    > All the dishes and restaurants have their own unique page. The dish page also shows other dishes by the restaurant thus making at attempt at upselling. The dish page adapts it's color theme according to the image of the dish making sure the images appear vibrat and poppy. 
    Eg:
    <p float='left'>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6xcovsv/image/upload/v1666705907/userdata/Screenshots/Screenshot_20221025_071732_fjatzi.png" width=500>

    </p>

### **• Backend-Features**

- The website has a home grown authentication system which stores the users in the postgresql powered database and the passwords are **sh256 encrypted** to ensure the user's privacy even if somehow the database were to malfunction.
- The api endpoints are secured by api keys and access is also allowed to authenticated requests _i.e: if the incoming request is coming from a browser where the website has been logged into by a registered user or restaurnant_. Api keys allow access to CLI commands or custom front end development and also allows other developers to implement marsfood into their programs without causing a security flaw to marsfood. Any developer may request an api key with custom quotes and max limits by contacting ***[marsfood.online@gmail.com](mailto:marsfood.online@gmail.com)***. The API comes with understandable endpoint structure and URL structure.
- All endpoints are categorised into their respective HTTP types _(i.e: GET, POST, PUT & DELETE)_ with proper status codes depending upon what happens in the request. also important endpoints have an extra layer of security by making sure changes to crucial data can only be made if the request is made by the proper author. Eg: a logged in restaurant still won't be able to just go to delete dish endpoint and inject custom headers and be able to delete aur modify the data of another restaurant, the same goes for users.
- When checking out, the user can autofill the address by allowing location access to the website.
- All endpoints are secured from being accessed by non logged in users and restaurants are prevented from hitting user endpoints and vice versa.
- The site heavily focuses on keeping the environment secure which is important for an ecommerce app as it deals with actual real life trades
- It is made sure that during registration users input valid names and emails, this is achieved by simple regEx checks. this is also done for restaurants.
- Images are uploaded to cloudinary when the restaurants are uploading a dish image. The images are restricted to be less than 2.5 megaBytes and this is achieved by fileuplaod express middleware.
- Images have the `loading=lazy` property on the pages with a lot of images to make sure not to waste the user's bandwidth and to make sure the site loads quickly _(this property ensures that images are loaded only if they are visible on the screen, otherwise the request to load the images is not made which save's the user's data consumption and bandwidth)_
- The express router has custom functions such as renderHTML which allows to enter parameters when rendering the html files and which are accessible both via html and js `#%=<parameter name>` in HTML and `params.<paramater name>` in JS. This somewhat of a custom templating/rendering engine allows custom components to be devloped reducing the codebase and making customization a lot easier. `$%=<component name>` into the html inserts the component into the page also loading the component's respective css and js. the css is loaded in a top to bottom order to make sure page specific styling can be applied to components. This exploits the cascading behaviour of CSS.
- All parent routes have their own seperate router files and router objects thus allowing easy changes and also making sure no unnecesarry middleware is used when it's not required.
- Emphasis has been put on making the site load faster thus opening the prospects of turning it into a PWA if required. The website is completely responsive and mobile loading times have also been taken into consideration. Special meta tags are inserted into all html files before serving them (this is done by the custom rendering functions discussed earlier) to make sure the webapp can access all hardware capabilites a mobile phone has to offer.
The lighthouse scores are as shown :
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6xcovsv/image/upload/v1666710849/userdata/Screenshots/Screenshot_20221025_083415_ihcgos.png" />
- The website judges the top dishes and restaurants on not just the basis of their overall review but also the amout review they have _(i.e: a dish with 5 star rating but only 2 reviews would rank lower than a dish with 4 stars but 10 total reviews)_ thus making sure quantity and quality are both taken into account.
This score is assigned by algorithmicly by the backend before serving the api requests asking for ratings of particular dishes/restaurants. Restaurants also are given a rating by considering the reviews of each of their dishes and averaging them. The thumbnaisl of restaurants are the same as the thumbnail of their top rated dish (again, taking into consideration the aforementioned algorithmic score).
- Searching algorithm is implemented and it works even when the user makes a typing mistake or describes even a broad category.
